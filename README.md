## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this Dashboard is to create a presintation for potential investors into a bike sharing venture in the city of Des Moines. The data is based on an already existing bike sharing business in Manhattan NY Called Citibike. This dashboard uses a collection of datacharts to provide a visual presentation of the data to the targeted audiance. 

## Results: 

We wanted to start our presentations with a basic chart that shows how bikes are in use and for how long they're viewed on average. Cities are getting more densly populated and places like Manhattan are not suitable for cars anymore. Bikes have become the go to for not only tourists but the locals. We see that most rides fal under the 1hr duration with the largest bulk being five minutes rides.

Our data shows that women make up the largest bulk of users. This would help our marketing team better know who to target and how to target their ad campaign based on this data and other data we have available.

The most popular use times are the same accross all genders. 6 AM- to 9 AM when people are going to work, and 4 PM to 8 PM for leaving work. This means that aside for tourist, the

When we divide our Tripduration data by gender we see that usage is simialr accross the board.

We can expect a decent number of subscribers to our service as the majorty of users are subscribers.

Being that times of user aren't randomized. It would be alot easier to figure out when it's time to maintain the bikes, and any other needed procedures that would require the bikes be temporary out of service.

We already have a system inplace that can tell us which bikes are due for service based on how much usage it's seen throughout it's life.

## Summary:

In conclusion. We know that bike sharing is more popular with women, and we know that for the city of Manhattan, bike sharing is a reliable means of transport for getting around in the city. The city Des Monines Iowa is projecting lots of urban growth in the near feature and they hope to emulate the Manhattan model. If this project were to be realized than a bike sharing business does have a place in the city. For now, the lovely scenary of the city is very attractive to tourist. Many will wish to get an intamite view of the city which is best acheived on the back of bike then in a rental car. 

I would add the Start and Stop maps to the Story page to show where the hubs for the bikes should be placed around the city. I would add popular markers on that map to show why certain arears are hotspots for stopping or starting.
